# Port
website, mine
It's a portfolio and nook. Not sure what else to do but it feels like a decent resume thing
I want a job where I can work towards interacting with blockchains at a full stack 
capacity for 5-10 years so I can make good money working on a product or service that I 
support and believe in with some people I would want to see outside of work.
